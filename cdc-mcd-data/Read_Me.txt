This page contains the U.S. public-use ICD-9/ICD-10 comparability file.  The file 
itself is compressed using the PKZIP format.  Decompressing the 
"ICD9_ICD10_comparability_public_use_ASCII.ZIP” file produces an ASCII file named 
"ICD9_ICD10_comparability_public_use_ASCII.DAT."

A document describing the layout of the ICD-9/ICD-10 comparability file as well as its 
application and significance is included on this page under the name 
"ICD9_ICD10_comparability_file_documentation.pdf."  This document has been included as 
a PDF file.
