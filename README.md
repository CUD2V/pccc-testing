# Testing and Benchmarking of the pccc R Package

This repository provides testing and bench marking of the
[pccc](https://github.com/dewittpe/pccc) R package.  Some of the tests and
benchmarks will be publicly reproducible, some will not.  The first several
sets will be based on the results and data sets noted in 
["Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version
2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and
transplantation" by Chris Feudtner, James A Feinstein, Wenjun Zhong, Matt Hall
and Dingwei Dai](http://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2431-14-199).


## 001 Multiple Causes of Death

A test of the pccc package using both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes based on the 1996
doubly coded CDC Multiple Causes of Death.  This is public data set that can
found at ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/health_statistics/nchs/datasets/Comparability/icd9_icd10.

This data has been made part of this repository in the `cdc-mcd-data/` directory.
