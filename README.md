# Testing and Benchmarking of the pccc R Package

This repository provides testing and bench marking of the
[pccc](https://github.com/dewittpe/pccc) R package.  Some of the tests and
benchmarks will be publicly reproducible, some will not.  

The first three
subdirectories are testing and benchmarks based on the
the published results and data sets noted in 
["Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version
2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and
transplantation" by Chris Feudtner, James A Feinstein, Wenjun Zhong, Matt Hall
and Dingwei Dai](http://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2431-14-199).
